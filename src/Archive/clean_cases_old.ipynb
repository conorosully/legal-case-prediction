interests external studies have concluded that journalists reporting can often be influenced by financial inducements leading to against this background the state has tolerated the accumulation of significant arrears by a number of the largest media companies including most major private tv stations such a situation may compromise editorial independence and media monitoring studies have observed that the tv news is notably less critical of the government than the written press there are also credible reports of locally elected officials using public office to influence the editorial policy of local newspapers radio and tv stations through the selective award of public advertising contracts',\n",

applicant s submission after those two documentaries threatened to make his companies insolvent as a result of inspections by the financial authorities according to the information provided by the first applicant was at the time a member of parliament affiliated to the party in power and was referred to in the press as a local baron on january the local financial authorities of attempted to carry out an unannounced inspection at the head offices of tele in view of the first applicant s opposition he was fined by the financial authorities the fine was however subsequently annulled because it had been imposed according to the applicant in breach of the statutory provisions which required giving days notice to the company concerned before an inspection could be carried out an inspection was subsequently carried out however and the authorities found that the company owed significant amounts to the state budget an agreement for the staggered repayment of the sums due was entered into with the first applicant in his submission the inspection had followed a request made by to who was head of the local public finance directorate and who at the time was an associate of in a number of commercial companies the first applicant explained that having regard to the high amount of the aggregate debt and the fact that it was repayable immediately and in order to avoid insolvency he had been persuaded to sell his majority interest in the company tele to and to the company which belonged to the wife and son of he thus ceased to be a shareholder on august on the same day the applicant

newsroom of radio m plus stefan cel mare this decision was upheld at last instance by the bacău court of appeal on march the courts noted in particular that the head offices of radio m plus and tele m were located in the same building and that the companies were therefore entitled to make use of it for their activities they concluded that the barring of the applicants from the radio s newsroom by tele constituted an unlawful action that was likely to cause prejudice to the activities of the radio station in which the applicants held the posts of manager and editor respectively steps taken by the applicants to enforce the neamţ county court s final decision of december on january on the applicants request the court of first instance ordered the enforcement of the neamţ county court s

equipment was located on march the applicants reiterated their request for the enforcement of the final decision of december as in the meantime an appeal by the defendant against that decision had been dismissed a fresh attempt at enforcement took place on may but was unsuccessful on that occasion the bailiff noted that the decision to be enforced was clear and that it was not necessary to initiate court proceedings in order to clarify the meaning and scope of its operative provisions on january on account of their inability to exercise their profession as journalists following the refusal by tele m to allow them access to the radio s newsroom the applicants filed a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor for opposition to the enforcement of a final decision on july the public prosecutor at the court of first instance gave a decision discontinuing the proceedings finding that the dispute actually concerned the implementation of the partnership agreement signed on august on january the principal public prosecutor confirmed the discontinuance on february the applicants lodged an urgent application requesting the courts to order tele m to comply with the partnership agreement of august and for that purpose to hand over to them any radio production and broadcasting equipment that was necessary for the implementation of that agreement they further sought an order that the company be fined million romanian lei rol per day of in a final decision of october the sibiu county court dismissed the application finding that it concerned the merits of the question of the performance of the agreement rather than a temporary or urgent situation justifying an immediate injunction on october the company tele m returned to the company radio m plus the equipment of which the latter was the owner on march the first applicant filed a criminal complaint with the court of first instance against the shareholders and managers of tele m for refusing to allow him access to the newsroom and to the equipment necessary for radio programmes thus preventing him from exercising his profession as journalist on june the first applicant was informed that his criminal complaint had been referred to the public prosecutor at the court of first instance which had opened criminal proceedings against three managers of the company tele m for embezzlement he was not kept informed of subsequent developments in the proceedings the court has not been informed whether the applicants have brought proceedings for the performance of the partnership agreement of august between the companies radio m plus and tele in their written observations of june the government informed the court as follows according to the information notified by the bailiff he was unable to pursue the enforcement procedure in view of the of the claim enforcement of an obligation to perform and the legal nature of the premises and moreover having regard to the fact that the writ of execution did not precisely stipulate the location of the newsroom of radio m plus srl or describe its composition in those conditions the bailiff stated that he was not competent to go beyond the legal operation of the radio station radio m plus on january the national audiovisual council the nac ordered the company tele m to terminate the assignment of audiovisual licence no as provided for under the partnership agreement of august and to ensure that its situation became lawful within thirty days in view of the fact that the said agreement was in breach of the new audiovisual act law no which prohibited the exploitation of an audiovisual licence by anyone other than its legal beneficiary there is no evidence in the file to show whether the order was followed by a decision by the nac to withdraw the licence in accordance with the law however on june the company tele m once again assigned the rights to audiovisual licence no to a third company in a decision of november that company obtained a broadcasting permit for the purpose of which it was to use a transmitter belonging to the company radio m plus nevertheless it can be seen from the case file that in a decision of november the nac temporarily suspended the licence assignment until the finalising of the dispute that had in the meantime arisen between the two companies it was only on november that the third company secured the right to use a new transmitter according to an nac certificate of june issued at the request of the romanian government s agent the company radio m plus held audiovisual licence no dated may for the city of in respect of the radio station of the same name and a broadcasting licence of may issued by the national regulatory authority for communications the company also held two

       " 'law': 'alleged violation of article of the convention the applicants complained that the competent authorities had not assisted them effectively in their endeavours to enforce the neamţ county court s final decision of december and that the had prevented them from working as journalists thus breaching their right to freedom of expression they relied on article of the convention which reads as follows everyone has the right to freedom of expression this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers this article shall not prevent states from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprises the exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the merits the parties a the applicants the applicants began by arguing that article of the convention was applicable in the present case they observed that in spite of their numerous endeavours they could not gain access to the radio station s studios and equipment thus finding it impossible to secure the enforcement of the decision of december and consequently being unable to exercise their profession of radio journalist they mentioned that before and after the partnership agreement they had run the newsroom of radio m plus in their submission and contrary to what the government had claimed the radio station had continued to broadcast even after october when they were first refused access to the newsroom the work of which had then been taken over by other journalists from the company tele the applicants asserted that this situation was the result of a conflict between the first applicant and the local representatives of a major political party who were annoyed by the first applicant s independent journalism in this connection the applicants referred to the court s to the effect that dismissal from employment following a course of action made up of an indeterminate number of acts of communication or expression that the applicants had committed over a period of several months in the particular context of a labour dispute between them and their employer represented a breach of their right to freedom of expression and grecu no september in their opinion even though the present case did not concern a dismissal in several aspects their situation was tantamount to a dismissal with similar effects the inability for the applicants to exercise their profession as radio journalists moreover they observed that the court had previously examined under article of the convention the impact of unlawful actions by third parties which were perceived as obstacles to freedom of expression even though they had had the possibility of writing articles in newspapers the applicants observed that the situation at issue had prevented them from freely choosing their form of expression which was guaranteed by article de la convention they emphasised that it was not for the public authorities or third parties instead of the journalists themselves to choose the manner in which the latter carried out their work of imparting information and ideas in addition following the failure to enforce the decision of december the applicants had not had access to the technical facilities for the transmission of radio programmes whereas the convention also protected the means used for the imparting of information and ideas they referred to ag may series a no the applicants then observed that the present case did not require an examination of any interference by the state with the exercise of their freedom of expression but rather an analysis of its positive obligation under the convention they took the view that the national authorities in the present case had a positive obligation to provide them with a system that enabled them to obtain the performance of an undertaking from an individual and that the authorities had a duty to act with the requisite diligence to assist them in enforcing the judicial decision given in their favour on december as a result of which they would have been able to exercise their profession as radio journalists they pointed out that the court had already noted the existence of such an obligation under article of the convention in cases concerning individuals obligations to act in their view the transposition of such an obligation to the of article of the convention would be consistent with the principle of proportionality between the general interest and the interest of individuals and would not represent an impossible or disproportionate burden for the state given that no new obligations would be imposed on it lastly the applicants took the view that in determining the positive obligation in the present case it had to be taken into account that freedom of expression was exercised by professional journalists and that the obstacles complained of affected the diversity and plurality of means of expression in addition it was also necessary to take into account the situation of the press in romania in the relevant period as described in a number of reports by various national and international organisations the applicants went on to complain of the failure to fulfil the mentioned positive obligation in this connection they first referred to the ineffectiveness of the enforcement procedure that they had initiated they pointed out that the bailiff responsible for the enforcement had not been sufficiently diligent even though he had considered the applicants to have a clear writ of execution especially as it had been obtained in urgent proceedings and had thus by definition required urgent intervention they further argued that the bailiff under the provisions of the code of civil procedure could have sought police assistance in actual fact the bailiff had merely paid a visit on his own to see the radio equipment on the second floor of the building moreover the bailiff had not closed the enforcement procedure leaving them in a state of uncertainty lastly the applicants disputed the arguments that the bailiff had apparently transmitted to the government in eight years after the events and which had never been notified to them beforehand secondly the applicants complained of the refusal by the criminal authorities to impose a sanction on the representatives of the company tele m and the fact that no other effective mechanisms were available to them to obtain the enforcement of the obligation to act which would have enabled them to gain access to the radio station thirdly the applicants emphasised the consequences of the of the decision of december for the exercise of their profession they argued that unlike the situation in santé pratique sarl no december where the applicant company had been able to transmit information by other means such as via the internet and had continued the publication of that information in a different magazine in the present case the applicants had not been able to transmit information by equivalent means and indeed had not done so for the applicants journalists specialising in radio and television the occasional writing of articles in newspapers was not a real alternative because that was a different style of journalism as the court had already noted in other cases the potential impact of the means of transmission of opinions was of particular importance for freedom of expression because it was commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media had a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media the applicants referred to and others no commission decision of april decisions and reports lastly the applicants observed that they had been editors in a local radio station which broadcast information and programmes of local interest they were thus addressing a local audience which had a good knowledge of the subjects covered as a result the possibility offered to the second applicant of publishing a few articles in a national daily newspaper which by definition was aimed at a nationwide readership was not an equivalent means and could not be construed as exercising her profession moreover the first applicant had not exercised his profession not even by writing a few articles for several years after the events at issue in any event the possibility of exercising their profession and thus their freedom of expression by other means writing in a gazette taking part in a television programme was purely speculative and theoretical because such activities did not depend only on the good will of the applicants but rather on that of third parties in addition that type of argument could have stifled all applications in which the dismissal of journalists was at issue because in all such cases the applicants could have found another job in the media moreover to have the opportunity to write an article from time to time for a newspaper or to be invited to take part in a radio or television programme did not constitute the exercise of their profession and did not represent an equivalent means to that of an editor in a radio station b the government the government were of the view that there had been no interference with the exercise by the applicants of their freedom of expression they thus pointed out that radio m plus had not engaged in any activity in the period in view of the unlawful assignments of the rights to licence no see paragraph above they further observed that the material in the file showed that the second applicant had worked as a journalist for the national daily in october similarly there had been nothing to prevent the first applicant from writing in a newspaper or preparing television programmes in the alternative the government argued that any interference with the applicants freedom of expression in the present case was prescribed by law namely by the legislation concerning the enforcement of a final decision it also pursued a legitimate aim that of the protection of the rights of others lastly the government were of the opinion that the margin of appreciation afforded to the national authorities as to the existence of a pressing social need corresponding to the impugned interference had not been overstepped and that the interference had been both necessary in a democratic society to ensure respect for the rights of third parties and to uphold the law and proportionate in that connection they pointed out that the applicants could have exercised their freedom of expression by means other than radio journalism the court s a general principles the court reiterates the key importance of freedom of expression as one of the preconditions for a functioning democracy genuine effective exercise of this freedom does not depend merely on the state s duty not to interfere but may require positive measures of protection even in the sphere of relations between individuals thus in the case of and others the united no echr the court had to examine the united kingdom s obligations in relation to the refusal by a private company which owned a shopping centre to allow the applicants to set up a stand there and distribute leaflets in which they sought to draw the attention of their fellow citizens to their opposition to the local authority s plans to develop a playing field and thus to deprive their children of green areas to play in the court decided that where the bar on access to property had the effect of preventing any effective exercise of freedom of expression or it could be said that the essence of the right had been destroyed it would not exclude that a positive obligation could arise for the state to protect the enjoyment of the convention rights by regulating property rights the court further reiterates that in determining whether or not a positive obligation exists regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the general interest of the community and the interests of the individual the search for which is inherent throughout the convention the scope of this obligation will inevitably vary having regard to the diversity of situations obtaining in contracting states the difficulties involved in policing modern societies and the choices which must be made in terms of priorities and resources nor must such an obligation be interpreted in such a way as to impose an impossible or disproportionate burden on the authorities see among other authorities no echr lastly in determining whether there is a positive obligation under article of the convention the court takes into account the nature of the freedom of expression in question its capacity to contribute to a debate on a topic of public interest the nature and scope of the restrictions imposed on that freedom the existence of alternatives and the weight of any competing rights of third parties or of the public in general see cited above and the court would lastly refer to its finding that the of a judicial decision in favour of a historian constituted a violation of article of the convention in view of the fact that the decision was an essential element of the exercise of the applicant s right to freedom of expression see no may b application to the present case of the principles in the present case the applicant obtained a final court decision ordering the representatives of the company tele m to give them access to the newsroom of radio m plus however that decision remained unenforced even after the applicants had initiated the enforcement procedure through a bailiff the court notes that the parties expressed different opinions as to the approach that it should adopt in examining the present case whilst the government were of the view that it should analyse the justification for a possible interference with the applicants rights the applicants alleged that there had been a breach of a positive obligation imposed on the state by article of the convention the court for its part would note at the outset that the authorities bear no direct responsibility for the restriction of the applicants freedom of expression it is not persuaded that any element of state responsibility can be derived from the fact that a private company prevented the applicants from gaining access to the radio station s newsroom compare cited above the issue to be determined however is whether the respondent state has failed to fulfil any positive obligation to protect the exercise of the applicants article rights from interference by others in this case by the representatives of tele the court will first examine the question whether the state had a positive obligation the applicants having regard to the specific circumstances of the case it is noteworthy in this connection that the court has already found fault with failures on the part of national authorities to act upon other types of unlawful conduct by third parties which had impaired journalists freedom of expression see cited above cited above and nos and and september on that point the court would refer to its under article of the convention to the effect that the right to the enforcement of final judicial decisions is an integral part of the right of access to a court see march of judgments and the question to be determined in the present case is whether in addition to a party s personal interest in the enforcement of a decision in its favour and the general interest of society in the proper administration of justice as established by the court in cases concerning the of final court decisions see cited above there is also an interest on the part of the applicants to have their right to freedom of expression upheld through the enforcement of a final judicial decision the court notes that the government did not dispute that by seeking access to the newsroom and facilities of the radio station radio m plus the applicants were seeking to exercise their profession as radio journalists and that this clearly concerned an essential element of their right to freedom of expression see cited above and a szabadságjogokért no april the government denied however producing a certificate from the nac to such effect that the radio station had carried on any broadcasting activity in the period see paragraph above and argued that the applicants could not therefore have worked as journalists in that company the court would point out that it is not called upon to rule on the lawfulness of the activities of a local radio station it notes that the nac certificate refers to the granting and assignment of audiovisual licences held by the companies at issue namely radio m plus and tele m and concludes that the radio station radio m plus had no broadcasting activity in the period however the court notes that the orders addressed by the nac following the various unlawful assignments were never followed up by a decision to withdraw audiovisual licence no exploited by radio m plus in accordance with the audiovisual act law no neither was any withdrawal decided under article of that act which allows the nac to withdraw an audiovisual licence in cases where its holder stops broadcasting programmes for days for technical reasons and for hours for any other reason see paragraph above having regard to the foregoing the court can not accept the government s argument that the failure to enforce the final decision of december did not breach the applicants freedom of expression on the ground that radio m plus had no broadcasting activity in the period the court further observes that the present case does not concern an inability to impart certain information or certain ideas to third parties but the form of exercise of a profession that the court recognises as having an essential role in a democratic society that of public watchdog see as a recent authority hannover germany no gc nos and february in conclusion an essential element of freedom of expression namely the form of its exercise was at stake for the applicants moreover it was not merely an aspiration to exercise such a right as the applicants had the technical facilities to transmit radio programmes the court notes that as can be seen from documents in the file the applicants were able to publish a few articles in the national and local press in and see paragraphs above however it accepts that the possibility of writing articles in newspapers can not compensate for the freedom of journalists to choose their form of expression in accordance with the court s case law article protects not only the substance of the ideas and information expressed but also the form in which they are conveyed see september series a no verlags gmbh no echr and santé pratique cited above it is not for this court nor for the national courts for that matter to substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists see cited above it is also necessary to take into account the potential impact of the medium concerned which is an important factor in relation to freedom of expression it being commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media see and cited above consequently the court is unable to accept the government s argument that the applicants had other alternatives by which to manifest their freedom of expression in addition the court would reiterate that the state is the ultimate guarantor of pluralism especially in relation to media whose programmes are often broadcast very widely see lentia and others november series a no that role becomes all the more indispensable where the independence of the press is subjected to external pressure by politicians and economic consequently particular weight should be given to the romanian context as regards the freedom of the press at the relevant time according to reports published by various national and international organisations the situation of the press in romania during the period does not appear to have been satisfactory one of the main findings of those reports was that the local press was directly or indirectly under the control of political or economic figures in the region the court can not disregard the first applicant s claim that he was subjected to political and economic pressure leading to the sale of part of his stake in a television company see paragraphs above in those circumstances the measures that the state was required to take in view of its role as guarantor of the pluralism and independence of the press are of genuine importance having regard to the foregoing the court is of the opinion that the national authorities were required to take effective measures in order to assist the applicants in the enforcement of the final and enforceable judicial decision of december delivered by the neamţ county court in spite of their endeavours the applicants were refused access to the radio station s newsroom only the equipment belonging to the company radio m plus was returned to the first applicant on october the court reiterates that the exercise of state powers which affects convention rights and freedoms raises an issue of state responsibility regardless of the form in which these powers happen to be exercised see no echr and no january in addition the decision by a respondent state to delegate some of its powers to a particular body can not relieve it of the responsibilities it would have incurred had it chosen to exercise them itself see cited above consequently the state as holder of public authority was required to act diligently and to assist the applicants in the enforcement of the decision in their favour more specifically through the intermediary of the bailiffs the court notes that in the present case the applicants rapidly sought the enforcement of the decision of december as a result a bailiff accompanied them on two occasions to the head office of the radio station but the applicants were received in an empty room on the ground floor of the building and only the bailiff was able to visit the studios containing special equipment on the second floor of the building see paragraphs above even though the bailiff noted that the enforceable decision was clear and that there was no need to apply to a court in order to clarify the meaning and scope of its operative provisions he did not seek the police support or assistance that was necessary in view of the uncooperative attitude of the other party and took no other steps to obtain the enforcement of the decision in the applicants favour given what was at stake in these proceedings for the applicants who were seeking to exercise their profession as radio journalists and in view of the fact that the decision in question had been obtained through an urgent application the enforcement procedure called for urgent measures the court can not accept the reasons given by the bailiff to the government in in order to justify the of the decision of december see paragraph above it does not appear from the evidence in the file that those reasons were notified to the applicants being raised for the first time in the proceedings before the court see no march in so far as the government argued that the applicants could have lodged an objection to the enforcement procedure under article of the code of civil procedure or initiate disciplinary proceedings against the bailiff under law no to complain about his refusal to perform an act of enforcement the court would observe as it found in a previous judgment that the government have not demonstrated the effectiveness of the remedies in question see no november and no july and notes that they have not submitted any evidence that could lead the court to reach a different conclusion in the present case in particular the government did not provide any examples of domestic to prove that the applicants could have held the bailiff liable for failing to notify them of his refusal to continue the enforcement and of the official discontinuance of the procedure neither did the government indicate how the disciplinary action could have been a remedy directly accessible to the applicants and capable of securing the enforcement of the final decision bearing in mind that such action could be brought only by the governing board of the bailiffs association or by the minister of justice and could only lead to the bailiff s suspension from his duties see no june as regards moreover the government s argument that the applicants could also have obtained enforcement under article of the code of civil procedure or could have brought proceedings under article of that code to obtain a coercive fine or an award of damages against the other party the court first notes that the government did not show how the applicants could have secured the application of article whether by enforcing the obligation themselves or through the intermediary of a third party as regards the possibility of bringing proceedings to obtain a coercive fine or an award of damages against the other party under article of the code of civil procedure the court notes that these remedies suggested by the government are indirect means of enforcing a final decision and are not therefore capable of providing direct redress for the alleged violation even supposing that having regard to its special nature the obligation to enforce required the obligor s personal intervention and that such means of coercing the obligor could in principle have proved to constitute effective and accessible remedies the court observes that in the present case the applicants had already used other indirect means namely the two criminal complaints without securing the enforcement of the final decision according to the court s an applicant must have made normal use of domestic remedies which are likely to be effective and sufficient and when a remedy has been pursued use of another remedy which has essentially the same objective is not required see no june in view of the foregoing the court finds that the applicants initiated sufficient acts of enforcement and took the necessary steps to obtain the enforcement of the final decision of december however the main legal resource available to the applicants to obtain the enforcement of a decision in their favour namely the use of a bailiff proved to be inappropriate and ineffective in addition by failing to take effective and necessary measures to assist the applicants in the enforcement of the final and enforceable judicial decision the national authorities deprived the provisions of article of the convention of any useful effect and compromised the exercise by the applicants of the profession of radio journalist accordingly the court must dismiss the government s objection that domestic remedies have not been exhausted and finds that there has been a violation of article of the convention',\n",
